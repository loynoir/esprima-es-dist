### Brief
The `./dist` directory of `https://github.com/loynoir/esprima`

### Why a repo?
In case you have problems with building it from github

### Why seperate?
Original repo not publish js on `./dist`, so somehow respect that.
But I have no idea how to fork on my own fork.

### Original  repo

### Forked repo

### Copyright

### Future
